Ecommerce Sales Analysis â€“ SQL Project
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates SQL skills for data extraction, analysis, optimization, and reporting using a sample e-commerce sales dataset.
The task includes creating tables, inserting data, performing queries with filtering and aggregation, joining related tables, creating views, and optimizing performance with indexes.

ðŸ—‚ Database & Tables
Database Created:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE DATABASE task;
USE task;
Tables Created:
sales â†’ Stores sales transactions.
customers â†’ Stores customer details.
products â†’ Stores product details.

Example:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE sales (
    sale_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    sale_date DATE NOT NULL,
    customer_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    product_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    unit_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    total_amount DECIMAL(12,2) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (quantity * unit_price) STORED
);
ðŸ“Š Queries & Outcomes
1. Data Retrieval
Basic Selection:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM sales;
Retrieves all records from the sales table.

Filtering with WHERE:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT customer_name, product_name, total_amount
FROM sales
WHERE total_amount > 30000;
Outcome: Returns sales transactions where the total amount exceeded â‚¹30,000.

Sorting with ORDER BY:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT customer_name, product_name, total_amount
FROM sales
ORDER BY total_amount DESC;
Outcome: Displays sales from highest to lowest amount.

2. Aggregation
Group by Product:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT product_name, SUM(total_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_name;
Outcome: Shows total sales revenue for each product.

Aggregate Functions:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT SUM(quantity * unit_price) AS total_sales_amount FROM sales;
Outcome: Gives the overall revenue generated.

3. Joins
INNER JOIN:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT s.sale_id, s.sale_date, c.customer_name, p.product_name
FROM sales s
INNER JOIN customers c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
INNER JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id;
Outcome: Shows only sales with matching customers and products.

LEFT JOIN:
Retrieves all sales, showing NULL where customer/product info is missing.

RIGHT JOIN:
Shows all customers, even those without sales.

4. Views for Analysis
Product Sales Summary View:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE VIEW product_sales_summary AS
SELECT p.product_name,
       SUM(s.quantity * s.unit_price) AS total_sales,
       AVG(s.quantity * s.unit_price) AS avg_sales
FROM sales s
INNER JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name;
Outcome: Summarizes total and average sales per product.

Customer Sales Summary View:
Shows total spend and total orders per customer.

5. Query Optimization
Indexes Created:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_customer_id ON sales(customer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_product_id ON sales(product_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_date ON sales(sale_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_date ON sales(customer_id, sale_date);
Outcome: Improves performance for joins, filters, and aggregations.

6. Final Analytical Query
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT c.customer_name, SUM(s.quantity * s.unit_price) AS total_spent
FROM sales s
JOIN customers c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE s.sale_date >= '2025-08-01'
GROUP BY c.customer_name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
Outcome: Ranks customers by total spending since 1st Aug 2025.

ðŸ“ˆ Skills Demonstrated
SQL DDL (Create, Alter Tables)
SQL DML (Insert, Select, Update)
Filtering & Sorting (WHERE, ORDER BY)
Aggregations (SUM, AVG, GROUP BY)
Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)

Indexing for performance optimization

âœ… Conclusion
This task demonstrates the complete workflow of data preparation, querying, joining, aggregating, and optimizing an e-commerce sales dataset using SQL.
The results can be used to generate sales reports, customer insights, and product performance metrics, supporting business decision-making.
